# PFT Calculator

The [Army Physical Fitness Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Physical_Fitness_Test) is a general purpose test of bodyweight fitness that is scored based on age and gender and provides a simple benchmark of overall strength and endurance. Myriad calculators exist in app stores and online, but they generally are not fast, user-friendly, or produce easily exportable data. This program was developed to be a focused, simple way to score this test.

### Usage
This program is implemented using PHP and Javascript. Usage is simple: Input number of pushups, situps, and the run time; select age group and gender, then press submit to get results.

Results are produced in simple plain text that is easily selectable so that it can be shared or copy and pasted into a notes document for ongoing tracking of progress in the test.

Cookies are used to save the age group and gender settings. (Cookies don't work presently).
